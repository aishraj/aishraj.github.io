  <span class="post-date">Published Jun 18, 2016</span>
  <p>&lt;rant&gt; After continuously questioning the value brought to me by my LinkedIn account, I finally deleted my LinkedIn account last week. The feeling of deleting my LinkedIn account was very liberating. Unlike other social network on the Internet that brought some value to me, my LinkedIn account was a constant source of recruitroll email. Sourcing agencies and recruitrolls from places which I&rsquo;d not heard of sent a constant request to &ldquo;add me as a connection&rdquo;.</p>

  <span class="post-date">Published Mar 25, 2016</span>
  <p>Github today has sort of a monopoly when it comes to developers open sourcing their work. Be it open sourcing side projects or storing your editor/shell configurations, Github is the go to place for most people. Now this is not a post about how important (and big!) Github has become, this post is about how hard it has become to discover great open source projects on Github. Based on my experience, the usual discovery process starts out in IRC/Slack/Hacker News/Stack Overflow or during conversations.</p>

  <span class="post-date">Published Jun 24, 2015</span>
  <p>January 2015 was interesting month in many respects. First, I had just completed a two week long train journey covering all corners of India. Next, after spending about two years in the fintech world, I came to accept the fact that it was time for me to explore other domains. In between all this, something unexpected happened. Sometime late the previous year, I had applied for the Stanford Graduate School of Business&rsquo;s Stanford Ignite program.</p>

  <span class="post-date">Published Apr 11, 2015</span>
  <p>“Whatever grows will grow, Whatever dies will die Whatever works will work Whatever flies will fly, Whatever fails will fail What’s meant to soar will soar, I am planting seeds nothing more” As the crowd started to sing along the chorus, the singer, a Wharton educated young man who gave up a career on Wall Street to find his purpose in serving others slowly waved back and sang along. Soon, the song got over and the audience of four hundred odd, 20 somethings applauded cherishing the moment.</p>
