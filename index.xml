      <description>My name is Aishraj Dahal. I am full stack developer from Nepal, living in Bangalore, India. I&amp;rsquo;ve been hacking around computers since I was twelve and still do it for fun and for a living. Whenever I&amp;rsquo;m not glued to my computer hacking on something interesting, I read, travel and write. In case you&amp;rsquo;d like to litter my inbox, send me an email at [first four letters of my name]@[domain].com.</description>
