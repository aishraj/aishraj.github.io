                    <p>Github today has sort of a monopoly when it comes to developers open sourcing their work. Be it open sourcing side projects or storing your editor/shell configurations, Github is the go to place for most people. Now this is not a post about how important (and big!) Github has become, this post is about how hard it has become to discover great open source projects on Github.</p>

<p>Based on my experience, the usual discovery process starts out in IRC/Slack/Hacker News/Stack Overflow or during conversations. For a developer spending time committing and pushing code on Github, what would help is a way to discover great open source projects on Github itself. In the absence of a real project discovery mechanism, Github has turned into one unnavigable massive ocean of open source projects. The &ldquo;trending&rdquo;/&ldquo;explore&rdquo; pages by Github are the closest to what project discovery on Github looks like. Now while the explore and trending pages are helpful, they do not have a social element attached to them. As a result, discovering projects today is tied to the number of its Github stars. The de-facto credibility of a project, irrespective of its maintenance status or project commit activity is tied to its number of stars. The impact of Github stars goes so deep into most developers&rsquo; thinking today that, at times the decision of choosing to use a well written new library with fewer Github stars against choosing something that has a larger number of Github stars but a dead community, seems to be a rather unintuitive one .</p>

<p>In my opinion, it would be great if Github could recommended, newer projects or contributors to star/follow based on prior interest shown by a user. This would perhaps allow better project discovery in terms of both usage and contribution.</p>
