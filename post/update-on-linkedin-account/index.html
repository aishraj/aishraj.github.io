        <p>Less than four years ago, I wrote a <a href="https://blog.aish.io/post/do-you-need-a-linkedin-account/">post</a> questioning the need of having a LinkedIn account.
Since my views on this have changed since then, I want to first admit that while writing the original post, I failed at looking at the problem beyond the specific situation I was in. I admit that my assessment then was rife with my own biases. So in this post, I want to shed some light on situations that made me reconsider my views on this.</p>

<p>While a few things like a low signal to noise ratio in discovering meaningful information from one&rsquo;s connection still hold up true, I don&rsquo;t think that my original post represents what I think of it right now. In the years since, I have come to realize that as one meets people at professional settings, despite sharing email addresses or phone numbers in some cases, LinkedIn accounts serve as the purpose of what I like to think of it as the digital equivalent of sharing one&rsquo;s business card. In the years that followed, I have traveled to industry run conferences and have had the opportunity to talk to a lot of people. The lack of a LinkedIn account certainly has made it difficult for me to connect back with them.</p>

<p>Since the post came out, I&rsquo;ve also switched jobs two times. I&rsquo;ve also had several former coworkers who&rsquo;ve switched jobs away from the employer that we originally worked at. This made me realize that people&rsquo;s professional lives are constantly changing. There are people in my network who have since then gone to start companies, work for non profits, gone back to school or have written a book or started consulting. Discovering all this without having a place that one can look up someone in their network is very hard.</p>

<p>While it may be far from perfect, I have come to realize that a professional social network is something that provides a good amount of social value.</p>
