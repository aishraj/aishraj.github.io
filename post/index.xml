      <description>For decades, the efforts involved in planning and implementation of software localization was far greater than the use of localized software for South Asian locales. Today, despite the increase in use of localized software, the percentage of users in South Asia, who use localized software remains at a fraction of the total user base. What is even more daunting is that a large chunk of users use the Latin Alphabet to use transliterated version of their native languages.</description>

      <description>Abstractions are ubiquitous in the implementation of any modern day software system. In fact, they are so universal that popular abstractions like files` are part of the not only the programming vocabulary but have found their place in mainstream user experience as well. The utility and ubiquity of abstractions is perhaps made more evident by the fact that the Fundamental Theorem of Software Engineering&amp;rsquo; which states that, &amp;lsquo;We can solve any problem by introducing an extra level of indirection&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>Recently, after learning that the Rust compiler tool-chain, now supported WebAssembly as a target, I got interested in experimenting with WebAssembly. In order to explore how Rust could be used to write code that compiled to WebAssembly, I decided to implement Conway&amp;rsquo;s Game of Life. My goal was to have as much of the grid traversing logic done in Rust as possible.
I started out by reading through a few chapters of the second edition of the Rust book.</description>

      <title>Service discovery with mDNS, Raspberry Pi and Go</title>

      <description>Today, yet again, I re-formatted by Raspberry Pi. It has become a sort of a ritual for me to format my Raspberry Pi and try out something new on it. This time around however, as I had moved to a new apartment, logging into my Raspberry Pi meant that I had to change my /etc/hosts mapping.
Now, /etc/hosts mapping had served my well but I had grown tired of updating this file, every time moved to a new place, despite of the static IPs that I assign.</description>

      <title>Debugging</title>

      <description>The art of debugging is certainly an underrated art in the software industry today. As the startups of yesteryears turn into the bigger corporations of tomorrow the amount of debugging required to find and fix bugs in existing pieces of code will be more relevant in the years to come. With the ever changing landscape of software, perhaps the day is not far when corporations of tomorrow ask a candidate to debug an existing piece of code or to perhaps improve the efficiency of the same, as an interview exercise.</description>

      <title>Side Projects</title>

      <description>At times, people look at me with bizarre bewilderment when I say that I had a great time hacking a side project on a weekend. For someone not in the creative world, doing something that is done for their day job without getting paid seems like a crazy idea. Paul Graham, in his now famous essay, Hackers and Painters talks about how hackers, like painters and composers, are “makers”. Most “makers”, unlike administrators attain perfection by performing gradual refinement of their work.</description>

      <title>Do you need a LinkedIn account ?</title>

      <description>&amp;lt;rant&amp;gt;
After continuously questioning the value brought to me by my LinkedIn account, I finally deleted my LinkedIn account last week. The feeling of deleting my LinkedIn account was very liberating. Unlike other social network on the Internet that brought some value to me, my LinkedIn account was a constant source of recruitroll email. Sourcing agencies and recruitrolls from places which I&amp;rsquo;d not heard of sent a constant request to &amp;ldquo;add me as a connection&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Discovery on Github</title>
      <link>https://blog.aish.io/post/github-starsystem/</link>

      <description>Github today has sort of a monopoly when it comes to developers open sourcing their work. Be it open sourcing side projects or storing your editor/shell configurations, Github is the go to place for most people. Now this is not a post about how important (and big!) Github has become, this post is about how hard it has become to discover great open source projects on Github.
Based on my experience, the usual discovery process starts out in IRC/Slack/Hacker News/Stack Overflow or during conversations.</description>

      <description>“Whatever grows will grow,
Whatever dies will die
Whatever works will work
Whatever flies will fly,
Whatever fails will fail
What’s meant to soar will soar,
I am planting seeds nothing more”
As the crowd started to sing along the chorus, the singer, a Wharton educated young man who gave up a career on Wall Street to find his purpose in serving others slowly waved back and sang along. Soon, the song got over and the audience of four hundred odd, 20 somethings applauded cherishing the moment.</description>
